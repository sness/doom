# doom

Doom Emacs (https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) is a new configuration framework for Emacs with strong opinions.  It is really taking off and has an active community.

I almost switched to the evil keybindings, but I've spent a long time getting my own custom keybindings working so they fit my workflow, so I turned off evil-everywhere mode, but philosophically I'm a supporter of what it's trying to do.
